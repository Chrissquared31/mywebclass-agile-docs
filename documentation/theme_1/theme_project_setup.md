# Theme 1.0: Project Setup
## Overview
Our project, MyWebClass, is a website that requires a development team to work together in parallel to produce various content that supports the objectives of the site. To start our project off using the "pull" approach to development, we will only focus on creating a basic web template that addresses any legal requirements that are relevant to our project, can be found using a search engine, allows us to legally use Google Analytics to measure user behavior on the site, and passes w3c validation, Lighthouse, GDPR Scanner.

To achieve this goal, we will need to focus on three major pieces of the project. Firstly, we will create Basic Project Documentation and Project Management processes to ensure that all team members are aligned and working towards the same goal. Secondly, we will establish a DevOps process that supports the development of the project, ensuring that we can effectively manage the development and deployment of our website.

Finally, we will develop the MyWebClass.org base website template with all technical and legal requirements satisfied to use Google Analytics and be appropriately listed in a search engine by implementing basic on-page SEO requirements. This will involve ensuring that the website template meets all necessary technical and legal requirements and is optimized for search engines.

In addition to planning the initial 0.1.0 release of the website template, we will also need to plan the ongoing development and improvement of the website. This will involve using agile methodologies such as Scrum to manage our development process, regularly reviewing our progress, and adapting our plans as necessary.

Our ultimate goal is to create a user-friendly, functional, and optimized website that meets the needs of our users and provides value to them. Throughout the development process, we will prioritize collaboration and communication, ensuring that all team members are aligned and working towards the same goal.
