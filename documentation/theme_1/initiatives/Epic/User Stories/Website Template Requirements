As a web developer, I want to develop a website template prototype that meets the legal and technical requirements and is optimized for search engines.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The website template prototype should comply with all relevant legal and technical requirements, including accessibility, privacy, and security regulations.
2. The website template prototype should be optimized for search engines, including proper use of headings, meta descriptions, and structured data, and should be tested to ensure it loads quickly and performs well on different devices.
