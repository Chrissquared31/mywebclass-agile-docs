Task Title: Set up continuous integration system

User Story: As a developer, I want to be able to continuously integrate and test my code changes to ensure they are working as expected.

The system should provide clear and timely feedback on the status of the build and tests, including any failures or errors that need to be addressed. The acceptance criteria for this task are:
The continuous integration system is set up and configured to build and test code changes automatically.
The system provides clear and timely feedback on the status of the build and tests, including any failures or errors that need to be addressed.
