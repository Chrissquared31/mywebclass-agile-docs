As a developer, I want to be able to continuously integrate and test my code changes to ensure they are working as expected.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The continuous integration system should automatically build and test the code changes for each push or merge to the code repository.
2. The continuous integration system should provide clear and timely feedback on the status of the build and tests, including any failures or errors that need to be addressed.
