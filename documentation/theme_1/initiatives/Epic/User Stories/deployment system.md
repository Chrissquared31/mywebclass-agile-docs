As a project manager, I want to be able to monitor the deployment process and identify any issues quickly.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The deployment process should be tracked in real-time, and any issues or errors should be logged and reported immediately.
2. The project manager should have access to a dashboard or monitoring system that provides visibility into the deployment status, including the ability to view logs, error messages, and other relevant data in real-time.
