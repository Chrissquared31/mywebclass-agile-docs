As a project manager, I want to have a project management process that outlines roles, responsibilities, and communication channels for team members, so that we can work together effectively and efficiently.

Acceptance Criteria:
1. The project management process should clearly define each team member's roles and responsibilities, including their specific tasks and deadlines.
2. The project management process should include communication channels that allow team members to easily collaborate and exchange information, such as regular meetings, 3. emails, and a messaging platform.
