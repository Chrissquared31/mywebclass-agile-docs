Description: This epic will focus on developing the necessary project management processes and tools to ensure effective collaboration and coordination among team members, and timely delivery of project milestones.

Goals:

2. Develop tools and systems to support project management, including task management, progress tracking, and reporting
3. Ensure timely delivery of project milestones and deliverables

User Stories:
1. As a project manager, I want to have a project management process that outlines roles, responsibilities, and communication channels for team members, so that we can work together effectively and efficiently.
2. As a team member, I want to have access to a task management system that allows me to track my progress and collaborate with others, so that I can contribute effectively to the project.

Dependencies:
1. Availability of team members
2. Access to necessary resources and tools, including project management software

Risks: Delay in completion of project milestones or deliverables
Mitigation: Establish clear timelines and deadlines, and ensure regular progress tracking and reporting

Estimated Effort: 4 weeks

Business Value: Improved project management processes and tools will lead to more efficient collaboration, better communication, and timely delivery of project milestones, ultimately resulting in a more successful project.

Priority: High. Effective project management is critical to the success of the project, and should be established early in the development process.
